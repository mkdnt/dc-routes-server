('Anacostia River Out and Back', 'Southeast', 4, 'Low', 'Trail/Path', 'Run out and back along the Anacostia River. Beginning at the riverwalk where it meets Benning Rd NE, go south along the path until you reach Pennsylvania Ave SE.'),
('Capitol Tour', 'Northeast', 6, 'Medium', 'City Streets', 'Beginning at the northeast corner of the US Capitol, run along Constitution Avenue, taking in landmarks along the National Mall, such as the Washington Monument, WWII Memorial, and various Smithsonian Museums. At the midpoint on 23rd St NW, there is a steep hill, which increases the difficulty of an otherwise flat run. After that, K Street will let you see the financial and business hub of DC as you make your wake back to your starting point.'),
('American University Hills', 'Northwest', 4, 'High', 'City Streets', 'Start at Ward Circle, next to American University. Go southwest down Massachusetts Avenue. Enjoy the downhill slope for a bit, but be warned: you will face a steep hill up toward the National Cathedral. You will get to relax going downhill after that until the halfway point at the Massachusetts Avenue Bridge, above Rock Creek Parkway. Turn around and head back up those hills, all the way to Ward Circle, and be amazed that you survived the steepness!');
